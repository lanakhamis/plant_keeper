## üåø Plant Keeper ‚Äì Project README

### üìò Project Overview

The Plant Keeper project is a practical Django web application designed to help users take better care of their plants.
It enables users to record important details such as plant name, species, and watering frequency, and provides reminders when it‚Äôs time to water them.

The main goal of this project is to make plant maintenance easy and consistent by offering an intuitive system that tracks watering schedules and plant health over time.

### üß† Objectives

-Help users manage their plants efficiently.

-Remind users when a plant needs watering.

-Store and track information such as plant name, type, and watering schedule.

-Demonstrate Python fundamentals including loops, conditionals, file handling, and date operations.

-Provide a base that can be expanded into advanced applications (with GUI or notifications)
